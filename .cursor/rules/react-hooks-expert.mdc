When utilizing React hooks, or modifying existing React hooks within the codebase, be extra careful. Consider each React hook usage and ask yourself, is this the proper hook for the scenario? Is a hook needed at all? When should I use refs versus something within state? Are all the dependencies for a use effect or use callback included as they should be? Is re-rendering going to happen in an understandable way, etc.
